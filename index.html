    <h1>Privacy Policy for Konki</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 23, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to <strong>Konki</strong>, a to-do list application developed
      using React Native and Expo. This Privacy Policy explains how Konki
      handles user information. Your privacy is important to us — we want you to
      know that
      <strong
        >Konki does not collect, share, or store any personal user data</strong
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Konki does not collect any personal information from users. The app does
      not require your name, email address, location, or any personal
      identifiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      All information created within the app (such as tasks and categories) is
      stored locally on your device using Async Storage. This means your data
      never leaves your device and is not transmitted to any external servers or
      third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>
      Data stored within the app is used solely for functionality, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Displaying and managing your personal tasks and categories.</li>
      <li>Preserving task states (completed or pending).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Konki does not analyze, sell, or share any user data.</p>

    <h2>4. Device Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      Konki does not request or require any sensitive device permissions. The
      app does not access your camera, microphone, contacts, location, or
      external storage.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Konki does not use any third-party services or SDKs that collect user
      data. It does not include advertising, analytics, or external APIs that
      track user behavior.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      All user data is stored only on your device. We recommend keeping your
      device protected (e.g., with a passcode or lock screen) since Konki cannot
      control the physical security of your device.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Konki is suitable for all ages. The app does not knowingly collect data
      from children or any users under any age.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When updates occur,
      the “Last updated” date at the top will be modified. All changes will be
      reflected within the app or on the page where this policy is published.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>
      If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please
      contact us at:
